# Sky + Vagrant

To get started with Sky easily using vagrant, simply clone this repo and run `vagrant up`:

```sh
$ git clone -b unstable https://github.com/skydb/vagrant.git
$ cd vagrant
$ vagrant up
```

Then you'll just need to wait for provisioning to complete.
Port 8585 is automatically exposed so you can use Sky from your host machine.
